- This is to get ready for the P2L service; since the P2L service matches the lecture's timestamp and the question by the lecture's text, generating a text for each lecture is a crucial step.
- This EXE file's purpose is to get rid of the need of dictating manually by automatically generate the text for each lecture uploaded.
